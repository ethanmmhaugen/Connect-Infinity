Connect Infinity â€“ A fully customizable Connect 4 Game

This project was an opportunity to practice pointers and OOP in C++, while also creating an AI using the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. The board is dynamically allocated so that it can be any (2D) dimension, and the win length can also be changed by the user. Here are the main features of the project:
-	Customizable board, down to the win length
-	Competitive AI with different settings, that can adapt to the different board conditions
-	An easy menu to toggle game options, including option to turn the AI off and play the game with 2 humans and change the pieces of each player
Features I plan to implement in the future:
-	Increase performance (game struggles with larger boards and large depth for the minimax algorithm)
-	Make a UI not based out of the terminal
-	Increase possible number of players in the name of customization
-	3D board option?
